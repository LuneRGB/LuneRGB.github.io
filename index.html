        🌱 I’m currently learning linguistics & computer science.
        <br>
        <br>
        🔭 I’m currently working on:
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;💡 building natural language datasets
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;💡 natural language embedding
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;💡 knowledge graph for scientific discoveries.
        <br>
        <br>
        ⚡ Fun fact:
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;💡 also interested in graphic design & European philosophy
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;💡 "lune", the French word "moon", relates to my real name "tide"
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;💡 while "RGB" stands for a wider scope of the colorful world
        <br>
        <br>
        💭 I'm dreaming of the computer's better acquiring human knowledge.
